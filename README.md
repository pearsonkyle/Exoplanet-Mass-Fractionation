# Exoplanet-Mass-Fractionation
Atmospheric hydrodynamic escape calculation for the crossover mass at which a heavier second constituent will not be dragged along with a lighter constituent (i.e. H).


The summary of this project is as follows: 
- Use Navier-Stokes Equation including Drag forces to model atmospheric escape from an exoplanet atmosphere
- Derive the energy limited escape rate from the planet using EUV spectra from MUSCLES Treasury Survey
- Derive diffusion coefficients using kinetic theory and van der Waal radius of atoms
- Compute the cossover mass (see Hunten 1987 for derivation) 

This project was completed for class PTYS 598B - Special Topics in Planetary Science (Atmospheric Escape) taught by Roger Yelle
